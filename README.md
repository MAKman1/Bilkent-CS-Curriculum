# Bilkent University CS Curriculum

Hi there,
 
As a Bilkent graduate, I understand the pain you're going through trying to find relevant study material. So, to collect some good karma, this is a collection of all my assignments, study content and homework from all of my 8(!) amazing semesters at Bilkent University.

Note:

- Be sure to use this content as a guide and stay away from plagiarism! (I've already graduated so it won't harm me but believe me, DC actions are no easy game)
- If you find something wrong or misleading anywhere, Kindly let me know and I'll be happy to update it with your version after verifying its correctness.
- Stay away from "CS426: Parallel Computing"! It was a weirdly hard course.
