HW01 ~ Hangman
==============
Individual Homework (graded)

Integration & Testing of Hangman code
Using the code pieces written by different groups, attempt to get the whole program working. Keep a record of what you do --in particular, record what went wrong and how you went about fixing it-- but also think about and record why the problems occurred in the first place and what might be done to avoid similar difficulties in the future. Try to keep track of the amount of time you spend on this exercise.

All this information should be written in a text file named "reflections.txt" 
which must begin with the following information:

   + the course code & section number,
   + your full name and id number,
   + the date,
   + your estimate of the time spent on this exercise,
   + and the final status of your code:  working/not-working.

Include your reflections.txt file in the root of the zip file you upload to Moodle.

Please upload your work (the Java code and your reflections) 
to the Moodle activity for your section, 
   (i.e. Sec01_HW01 or Sec02_HW01 or Sec03_HW01 or ...)
naming your file: SS_HW01_yourname.zip 
   (where SS is your section number and yourname is hopefully obvious!)

The deadline for submission will be announced by your instructor.
