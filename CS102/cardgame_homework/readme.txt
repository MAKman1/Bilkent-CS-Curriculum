CS102 - CardGame homework
=========================

This folder contains all the classes for the card game we designed in lectures.
It also contains a DrJava project file. 
If you are using a different IDE, simply copy all .java files as necessary
(note the src folder contains only the java source files, 
 the classes folder contains only the .class files).

You can find the lecture slides with the design online at 
http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~david/cs102/classmaterials/CS102_CardGame.ppt

Your task is to complete the game. First make sure the project compiles
and the CardGameTest class runs (ignore MyCardGame until everything else is working). 
Take a look at each of the Java classes, see how they correspond to the design. 
You will see many methods are left for you "ToDo" -- that's your homework!

This is a graded homework and must be done individually. 
Upload your solution to the moodle homework activity for your section 
by the specified due date with the usual filename format, "SS_HW2_yourname.zip".

If you have any questions related to this homework, please ask on the course forum.

good luck,

David.
